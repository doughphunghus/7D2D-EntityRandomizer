# 7D2D-EntityRandomizer
A 7 Days to Die modlet generator that makes copies of Entities and randomizes them.
The randomizer script that generates the modlet *is not yet published here* as it is not ready for general use BUT
modlets generated from it are being put here for use/comments to help polish the script for release.

Note: Only load ONE of the modlets in the table below that's specific to your game version!
| Currently generated Modlets  | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Doughs-RandomizedEntities-For-a19-b180 | There are 332 randomized vanilla zombies in the modlet (4x of the vanilla 83) |
| Doughs-RandomizedEntities-For-a19-b178 | There are 332 randomized vanilla zombies in the modlet (4x of the vanilla 83) |
| Doughs-RandomizedEntities-For-a19-b177 | There are 332 randomized vanilla zombies in the modlet (4x of the vanilla 83) |
| Doughs-RandomizedEntities-For-a19-b173 | There are 332 randomized vanilla zombies in the modlet (4x of the vanilla 83) |


Notes:
- This is still in a *very experimental* stage of development.  
  If a zombie in a modlet here is really bad, please submit an issue here with the name of the zombie
  Zombies names start with doughsR<number>
  You'll have to be in debug mode to see the name
- The generated entities are "generally" tougher/faster than the vanilla zombies. 
  The randomizer was tweaked to make slow/weak zeds more unlikely. They can still happen though.
- The vanilla zombies are not removed from the game.  This just adds more copies of them
- There is no cosmetic/skinning changes to the vanilla zombies. They all look the same, on purpose ;) 
  Other than a non vanilla speed, size or walk type, you can't tell what properties are different from the vanilla zeds as they approach
- I will be generating modlets with the names of this pattern: Doughs-RandomizedEntities-For-<major version>-<build version>
  This is the "modlet" folder you put into the Mods folder.
  It is highly likely that if you don't use the modlet with the *exact* same version of your game, there may be issues (like no zombies spawning)
  
- At a high level, the randomizer script (currently) that generates the modlet attempts to do these things:
  1. Make a copy of the zombie entities in the game, giving them a new, unique name
  
  2. For each entity, randomizes these characteristics:
  
    WalkType -> All walk types from 1-8 are given randomly EXCEPT if a zed was already a crawler, it will stay a crawler
    
    Mass -> Generally ties to the size. Smaller zed would have less mass.  Maybe makes ragdolling more real?
    
    Weight -> Generally ties to the size. Smaller zed would have less weight.  Maybe makes ragdolling more real?
    
    Size -> Zeds generally tend to randomize sto be maller than vanilla ones.  Though some can be larger.  Why? Because!
        Note: Some crawlers may be hand tuned after generation to generate small crawlers. Why? Because I wanted small crawlers.
      
    LegCrawlerThreshold -> Done so some zeds may have a greater chance to drop and crawl when hit
    
    MoveSpeed -> Zeds will tend to be faster than vanilla
    
    MoveSpeedAggro -> Zeds will tend to be faster than vanilla
    
    ExperienceGain -> Zeds will tend to give less EXP when killed than vanilla.
    
    HealthMaxBase -> Zeds will tend to have more health than vanilla.
    
  3. Loops and runs again, so more random copies can be made of each zed.  
  
  4. Writes out an XML modlet containing all the random entities, and adds them to all the entity groups they normally spawn in.
  
  Also note: 
  The "randomness" is not completely random.  Each metric gets a different "randomness" varience, and some metrics are tweaked.
  For example:
  - If a zombie is a crawler type, the zomnie copy will not have a random walk type ( because a legless crawler can float in midair if its made to walk)
  
  - I have chosen to make the "amount of randomness" usually center around the existing metric, e.g. if HealthMaxBase = 200, the "randomness" is centered around 200 using a "percentage. Like 200 +/- 30%.
  
  - In some cases, where its not easy to get a metric, I have manually chosen a metric to center the randomness around.
  
  - Some zombies may be "too big" to fit through doors ;)  generally I tried to center size randomness so they will not be, but it may happen
